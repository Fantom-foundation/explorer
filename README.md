2. Create a new branch from `development` with the pattern: `year/userName/feature`

For example: `2017/Kapil/Dashboard`

3. Make changes (**Please commit frequently whenever a change has been made. do not commit everything at once!**)
4. Commit frequently to `year/userName/feature`.
5. When a new task is completed or a significant milestone is reached, create a Pull Request (PR) to `development`.
6. Reviewers will review your Pull Request and accept or reject with feedback.
7. If rejected, review and fix and create another Pull Request.
8. If accepted, your changes will be merged into the `development` branch.
